# Weather-Dashboard

## Weatehr-Dashboard it is a website that that give us information about the weather from the city we are searching for. When we click the search button we reciving infromation about the weather like wind, humidity, temperature, uv index and also 5 day weather report for the searched city. Under the search button there is buttons from other city we have searched for(our search history), that are dynamicly created and if we click on them it will give us the weather info from that city. If our history is empty (we haven't search for a city) there will be no buttons and it will say No History.

## Weather-Dashboard is build with program languages like: Html, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Moment.js librarys and side Api's. Website structure was created with HTML and styled with Bootstrap. Logic was created with JavaScript where we used the side API's to fetch the city we are looking for and the weather information we are looking for that city. Moment.js was used to find the curent day of the week so we can present the 5 day forecast. We also used local storage so we can create history from the city we have searched.
